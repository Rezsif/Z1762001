    <h2>Rugby history</h2>
    <p>In 1871, English clubs met to form the Rugby Football Union (RFU). In 1892
        , after charges of professionalism (compensation of team members)
        were made against some clubs for paying players for missing work, the Northern Rugby Football Union,
        usually called the Northern Union (NU), was formed.[16] The existing rugby union authorities responded
        by issuing sanctions against the clubs, players, and officials involved in the new organization. After the schism,
        the separate clubs were named "rugby league" and "rugby union"
