<h1> About Me </h1>
<p>My name is Daniel Fiszer, Currently I am a senior at Northern Illinois University. I have lived in illinois
    my entire life, it too damn flat. I have played rugby for 10 years, it is a major part of my life and 
    I have made friends to last a lifetime. I like to walk and hike because it is easier on my torn knees than running
    I enjoy watching all types of sports and shows too many to list. I am trying to learn HTML because
    I believe it is not only an extremely valuable skill to have but also it is interesting to do
