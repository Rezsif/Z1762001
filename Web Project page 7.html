        <h1>UFC</h1>
        <p>I started to watch the UFC 3 years ago and i decied to add it because i am running out of 
          to type about. I enjoy watching all manner of sports from football and rugby to boxing 
        and the UFC. i enjoy watching becuase it is an interesting<br>
        The first fight that got me interested in the UFC is Max "Blessed" Holloway vs Anthony "Showtime" Pettis
        The fight was so fast and exciting that i was amazed it was 2 human men fighting. thats how i 
        became a fan of both fighters and the UFC in general. I keep watching and while sometimes i wish i didnt<br>
        After that i learned about the sport, the lengends, the heels, the guys and gals who fight before people even
        get to the bar. I find them interesting, men and women who put everthing on the the line for a scrap in an a 
        oddly shaped cage. they are like professional athletes who train all day for months to make less money then
        minor league baseball players. some of the best fights ive seen are <br>
        Holloway vs Pettis<br>
        DC vs Jones I&II<br>
        Ferguson vs Pettis<br>
        Mcgregor vs Diaz I&II<br>
        Silva vs Sonnen<br>
        Griffin vs Jackson<br>
        i could name 50 fights from both before and after i started watching, its interesting to see two
        people go out and risk everything for glory whether it be eternal glory or a passing spark
