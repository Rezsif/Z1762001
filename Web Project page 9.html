    <h2>Hiking </h2>
    <p>
        I enjoy hiking, plenty of times in my life i have been unable or unwilling 
        to go outside and breathe fresh air. I have had multiple broken bones and 
        torn ligaments that have rendered me unable to walk. it is terrible and made
        me realize that walking and hiking is an activity that i should enjoy. 
        So now i go and try walk/hike any time i can, from walking in local 
        forest preserves to hiking up and down the grand canyon its become something
        that help me enjoy life.

    <h2>Video games</h2>
    <p>
       When i had all the broken bones and torn ligaments I had to occupy my time
       somehow and there is only about 6 decent TVs on at a time so i needed something else to 
       do. Video games was the way to occupy the rest of the day, probably not the healthiest thing 
       but its what i did. I played too many video games in middle school and high school however 
       they are fun, its actually helped create friendships which i am thankful for.
